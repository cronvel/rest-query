# REST HTTP methods overview

* GET: *retrieve* an object or a collection of objects
* PUT: *create* or *update* (overwrite) an object in the collection, the object is placed at the exact place
  in the provided URI, with the exact MongoID provided, except if it violate uniqness, if an object exists, 
  it is replaced entirely by the new object. Also some PUT method can be rejected if the object already exists,
  thus favorising the usage of PATCH
* PATCH: *update* partially, update only parts of the object present in the patch body
* DELETE: *delete* the object (or the collection, if possible)
* POST:
	* *create* an object on the collection 
	* execute a methods of an entity, e.g. `POST /Users/{ID}/Auth` will authenticate the user with {ID} as ID,
	  here `Auth` is not an object or a property, it's a method of the user's object
	* POST always indicate something that cannot be done offline.

Maybe:
* SEARCH: search object with some criteria
* ORDERPATCH: order objects in the parent collection
* MKCOL: create a new collection, does make sens only in few context



# URL parsing

Each parts of the URL's path can be one the following:
* if it starts with an uppercased letter, it is a property of the parent object (it converts to the regular camelCase property name)
* if it is a 24 characters string of hexadecimal, it is a MongoID
* if it contains only decimal, it is an *offset* (the index of the element into the collection)
* if it is a string containing only character of the class `[0-9a-z-]`, it is a SID
* anything else is an error



# SID (Slug ID)

This is a human-readable ID, both intended to make user-friendly and SEO-friendly URL.
Also, a user's account identifier is a SID (rather than an email), this is consistent with Twitter @ syntaxe.

Requirement
* a SID is a string, and should at least contains 3 characters, and at most 72 characters
* allowed character are lowcase ascii alpha (a-z), digits (0-9) and hyphen (-)
* if the string happens to be a valid MongoID hexadecimal representation or a valid decimal arbitrary number, 
  then either an hyphen `-` is appended to transform it, or the SID creation is simply rejected



# MongoID's client-side creation

The original MongoID are built this way:

	Each MongoId is 12 bytes (making its string form 24 hexidecimal characters):
	* 4 bytes for a timestamp
	* 3 bytes are a hash of the client machine's hostname
	* 2 bytes for the two least significant bytes of the process id running the script
	* 3 bytes are an incrementing value

When creating a MongoID client-side, the 5 bytes `shortAgentID` is used as a replacement for the 2 middle part of the ID.

To sum up, the 12 bytes are built this way:
* 4 bytes for a client-side timestamp
* 5 bytes for the client's `shortAgentID`
* 3 bytes are a client-side incrementing value

Across any REST query, ID are sent in hexadecimal-encoded string, being in the URI part or in the JSON body, or anything else.



# MongoDB collections and documents requirement

## Special collection: agents

Collection's methods:
* create (POST) : create a new agent object, and return it

Object's data:
* _id (agentID) `MongoID` 12 bytes, generated by the auth server
* shortAgentID `Hexadecimal` 5 bytes/10 chars hash of the Agent-ID, it **\*MUST\*** be unique, also it could be quite difficult to enforce
  uniqness in a sharded environment
* key `String` a key used for the agent authentication
* lastConnection `Date` the last connection performed by this agent
* userAgent `String` the HTTP `User-Agent` header string of this agent
* meta `Object` specific application-side data are stored here

Object's methods:
* auth (POST) : authenticate an agent



## Special collection: users

Collection's methods:
* create (POST) : create a new user object, and return it

Object's data:
* _id (userID) `MongoID` 12 bytes, generated by the auth server
* SID `SID` here the SID is unique among all users
* email `Email` a valid email where the user can be reached (unique or not?)
* passwordHash `String` hash of the user password
* lastConnection `Date` the last connection performed by this agent

Object's methods:
* auth (POST) : authenticate an user



## Special collection: auth

Object's data:
* _id `MongoID`
* collection `String` collection's name for this auth entry
* userID `MongoID` the ID of the related user
* objectID `MongoID` the ID of the object in the collection



## Common properties of all application's collections

Object's data:
* SID `SID` (optionnal) Slug ID, sometime unique, sometime only unique on the current path's directory
* title `String` full featured title for this resource, most of time this property is used to create automatically a SID
