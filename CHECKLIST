Uncertain features:

.	Scheduler + userland worker
.	Attachment
.	populate security model
.	restrictedAccess (on collection's schema) is deactivated, should it be removed or refactored?
.	filter/skip/limit/filter check, security and so on
.	API Key user are not working anymore



Refacto:

.	Populate should not be done on primary request
		--> for single doc, use `document.populate()` afterward, so populate rules and rights are checked before eventually useless DB round-trip
		--> for multi docs, use `new Population()`, `document.preparePopulate()` and `world.populate()` afterward, so:
			- documents can be filtered out of the batch early (when there is no access granted to them)
			- some rules and rights can be checked first before the big `world.populate()`



Misc:

.	change all [array].concat(element) to ES6 [ ... array , element ]
.	hook and non-hoot context: move 'performer' and 'access' outside of 'input'? make them top-level?
.	remove ownKeys handler in RootsDB
