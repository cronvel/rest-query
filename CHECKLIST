Uncertain features:

.	Scheduler + userland worker
.	Attachment
.	populate security model
.	restrictedAccess (on collection's schema) is deactivated, should it be removed or refactored?
.	filter/skip/limit/filter check, security and so on



Misc:

.	change all [array].concat(element) to ES6 [ ... array , element ]
.	hook and non-hoot context: move 'performer' and 'access' outside of 'input'? make them top-level?
.	remove ownKeys handler in RootsDB
